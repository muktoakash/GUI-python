<h2>Genral Math Anxiety</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Different kinds of anxiety lead to different effects on intellectual performance.</li>
  <li>It has been demonstrated that mathematics anxiety exists among many individuals who do not ordinarily suffer from any other tensions.</li>
  <li><b>Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale</b> was constructed to provide a measure of anxiety associated with the single area of manipulation of numbers and the use of mathematical concepts.</li>
  <li>Mathematics anxiety involves feelings of tension and anxiety that interfere with the manipulation of numbers and the solving of mathematical problems in a wide variety of ordinary life and academic situations.</li>
  <li>Mathematics anxiety may prevent a student from passing fundamental mathematics courses or prevent his pursuing advanced courses in mathematics or the sciences.</li>
  <li>Among nonstudents, mathematics anxiety may be a contributor to tensions during routine or everyday activities, such as handling money, balancing bank accounts, evaluating sales prices, or dividing work loads.  </li>
  <li>Pre- to posttherapy changes were statistically significant.</li>
  <li>A no-treatment control group mean scores did not decline significantly at posttesting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Specific to MARS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mathematics anxiety is a fairly common problem in a college population and such an instrument could serve as a diagonostic tool.</li>
  <li>The instrument could be used in research to determine the relative effectiveness of different treatment approaches to anxiety problems.</li>
  <li>As an aid in the development of the anxiety hierarchy used in desensitization treatment.</li>
  <li>Normative data on changes in test scores occuring without treatment would prove useful in evaluating the results of studies where the control group is lacking and in evaluating the progress of individual clinical cases.</li>
  <li>High MARS scores are associated with poor performances on the mathematics test.</li>
  <li>Since high anxiety interferes with performance, and poor performance produces anxiety, MARS does measure mathematics anxiety.</li>
</ul>
